# Path_Signature_Work
Using path signature in data science, experiments


Hi everyone, this is my repository where I make experiments with path signature in data science, for my Internship in CENTAI INSTITUTE, Summer 2023.
I am analysing multivariate time series and, starting from the paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01852-0, I am trying to combine the tools of rough path theory with algebraic topology methods.
